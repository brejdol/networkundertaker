I have spent the last year preparing for a big network migration that will start late september 2022, and carry on well into april 2023. Many many VRFs, something like 6000 firewall rules. Everything EBGP. Everything is used 24/7. Many teams working. Fun, but very easy to get lost in the sheer volume of things. This consumes well over full time itself, and I have a few other projects too. And a company to run. And a few certs that needs to be taken.
