I have spent the last year preparing for a big network migration that will start late september 2022, and carry on well into april 2023. Many many VRFs, something like 6000 firewall rules. Everything eBGP. Everything is used 24/7 (yes, while we move it!). Downtime is baad. Many teams working. Fun, but very easy to get lost in the sheer volume of things. This project consumes well over full time itself, and I have a few other projects too. Like handling the global proxy/loadbalancer service for a company that has precence in  more than 120 countries. And sometimes help with troubleshooting other stuff there. Plus a few other customers. And I have a company to run. And a few certs that needs to be taken. The concept of "time" still puzzles me. Like, where did it go?
