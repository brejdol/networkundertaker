![Me](/jag.jpg)

I spend my days running technical projects, designing, (then breaking), securing, and troubleshooting enterprise networks that utilize a plethora of techniques (MPLS, EVPN/VXLAN, SPB, SR). I also work with cloud networking integrations, run IPv6 implementation projects, and I teach sometimes. Fluent in routing and switching protocols, under/overlays, firewalls and proxies, virtualization, and the adjacent technologies (PKI, Radius, Authentication, AD, DNS, DHCP etc). I take advantage of my earlier experiences as a formally trained musician/teacher in my daily work - Since it's all about cooperation, communication, timing and skill.

Certified on Fortigate firewalls (Datacenter NSE7 + SD-WAN NSE7), FortiADC, and FortiAuthenticator. And Aruba Wireless.

I try to lead my teams by example and knowledge, not by authority.
