Network Architect / Network Consultant


Name:	Rickard Andrinsson\\
Date of birth: 	03/11/74\\
Company:	NetIP AB Sweden\\

 
**Profile**

I am 49 years old, and live in Vallentuna north of Stockholm, Sweden, with my girlfriend and two kids. I work mostly as a network architect and network consultant.

**Competencies and projects**

I spend my days running technical projects, designing, (then breaking), securing, and troubleshooting enterprise networks that utilize a plethora of techniques (MPLS, EVPN/VXLAN, SPB, SR). I also work with cloud networking integrations, run IPv6 implementation projects, and I teach sometimes. Fluent in routing and switching protocols, under/overlays, firewalls and proxies, virtualization, and the adjacent technologies (PKI, Radius, Authentication, AD, DNS, DHCP etc). I take advantage of my earlier experiences as a formally trained musician/teacher in my daily work - Since it’s all about cooperation, communication, timing and skill.


I have worked in big projects where both excellency in one field as well as a broader knowledge is in demand. Both the research and inquiry part of the projects, as well as the actual work. Customers have been IT-companies, local counties, as well as service providers and ISPs. A few examples:

•	The migration of a very large network environment from old to new hardware. The environment had very strict uptime demands.
•	Inquiries and impact analysis regarding migration to cloud/off prem solutions (Financial sector)
•	Inquiries, workshops, impact analysis, education and implementation of IPv6 in different organisations (Companies and government)
•	Inquiry and review of security enhancing measures in the network environment (energy sector)

My earlier roles have given me a broad knowledge base, since I have been working in most fields within IT operations – SAN/NAS, backup, server operation, virtualization, PKI, AD, authentication, load balancing, and routing/switching.

I end up in projects where the broad knowledge is crucial in order to bring different vendors and equipment together. I am used to leading the work, within time and budget.

Well versed in the applicable switching/routing protocols, underlays/overlays, and various standards on the networking side of things.

My daily work includes architecture and planning, but also hands-on troubleshooting in complex network environments with very tight SLAs, and a lot of dependencies (health care for example), where many different vendors and providers must co-exist.

I work with routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers and wireless, and the adjacent systems they depend on (radius, AD, DNS, DHCP, PKI etc).

I have designed and built networks with authentication (802.1X), with dynamic VLAN-allocation in both the wired as well as the wireless network.

Education is very close to me, since I have a background as a teacher. I constantly try to update myself and to stay on top of the new tech and new standards. My goal is to try to be as vendor agnostic as possible. Understanding the standards is crucial. Teaching also makes you develop what you have learnt – Explaining complex networking simple is not easy!

Linux-user for the last 20 years. FreeBSD and Solaris are also close to my heart.

My own company (NetIP AB) run a hosting business where we operate servers, networking services and cloud integrations (AWS/Azure/GCP) for both small and big customers.

In my earlier role as SE, I have worked a lot with clustered systems that are critical to the company – Servers, storage, and networking, in environments that has more than 10000 users.
I also managed EMC, Dell, Tintri and Synology on the storage side. And Veeam and BackupExec on the backup side. Regarding servers – Fujitsu, IBM, HP, Dell, and SuperMicro.

I’ve worked with Microsoft server operating systems since Windows 2000 until now and have operational experience with the following services/roles: AD, CA, DHCP, DAG, DNS, Exchange, Failover Clustering, Hyper-V, NPS, TMG, SQL, IIS, SharePoint.

I have lead P2V projects using both Hyper-V and VmWare.

Dabbles in Python when needed. Have small-scale operational knowledge of Ansible. I have mostly worked with automation that’s already in place, built by someone else.

Used to change management and a formalized way of working, with high demands in security and traceability.

**Miscellaneous**

Uses the same Office applications as everyone else. Experienced with documenting solutions with drawings (Visio) and in text form (Word). Can explain tech to non-techs in a comprehensible way. Strong skills in planning, leading and executing.
